Snap SVG Platform Plugin for Flash CC
=====================================

This is a Custom Platform Plugin for Flash CC exporting animated content to SVG using the Snap.svg javascript library to render content.

This is an early stage **proof of concept**.

##Install
Open the SnapPlatform.zxp file found in the SampleCreateJSPlatform/EclipseProject directory. 
This should launch Adobe Extensions Manager. Follow instructions to install the plugin. Then proceed to create 
a SnapPlatform project and test/publish as usual.
