Snap SVG Platform Plugin for Flash CC
=====================================

This is a Custom Platform Plugin for Flash CC exporting animated content to SVG using the Snap.svg javascript library to render content.

The plugin is an early stage proof of concept. Currently to test the project directly from flash, the .fla must live at localhost on your server.

##Install
Simply open the SnapPlatform.zxp file found in the EclipseProject folder. This should launch Adobe Extensions Manager. Follow instructions to install the plugin.
Copy Runtime js directory into same directory as published project to load libraries necessary to run.
